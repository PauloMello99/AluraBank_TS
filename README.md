* There's no need to run anything, so you just need to open [app/index.html](https://github.com/PauloMello99/AluraBank_TS/blob/main/app/index.html) in some browser after downloading the project.

* But in order to code something else, you must:
#
1. [Have Node installed](https://nodejs.org/)
#
2. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```
#
3. Run TSC
```
npm start
```
#
4. Open [app/index.html](https://github.com/PauloMello99/AluraBank_TS/blob/main/app/index.html) in some browser
